## What is robologs

robologs is an open source library of containerized data transformations for the robotics and drone communities. With robologs, users are able to extract and transform slices of sensor data for a variety of use cases:

- Graph a subset of relevant time series signals
- Extract a subset of images for data labeling, annotation and model training workflows
- Convert binary data to formats that are supported by common tools
- Sample streams of sensor data for easier analysis
- Ingest filtered and transformed data into databases

If you are an engineer or scientist working in robotics, machine learning, computer vision or aerospace then you've probably had to write your own data extraction scripts from data formats such as ROS, PX4, ArduPilot etc. This can be tedious and time-consuming given the complexity of these data formats and their underlying system requirements. Even simple transformations such as converting a rosbag of images to a video, or creating a graph of battery data from a PX4 log can be challenging.

...well, not any more we say! 

## Python Quickstart<a name="python-quickstart" />

Installing robologs using the pip package manager is easy:

We suggest that you use a clean environment to avoid any dependency conflicts:
```python
conda create --name robologs_env python=3.8
conda activate robologs_env
```


```python
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple robologs
```

From here, you can type commands to transform data from log files. For example, if you want to extract images from a ROSBag file, type:

```python
robologs_get_images_from_bag -h
```

Or if you want to get metadata from a ROSBag file:
```python
robologs_get_summary_from_bag -h
```

## Use Docker 
You can build a local version of the robologs-image container as follows:
```bash
cd ~/Code/robologs
docker build --network=host -t robologs-image --file docker/ros1/Dockerfile .
```

And here is how you can run a robologs command using the docker container:
```bash
docker run --volume ~/Desktop/scratch/:/input/ -it robologs-image robologs-get-videos-from-bag -i /input/some_rosbag.bag -o /input/ --naming rosbag_timestamp --format jpg --save_images
```


## Data Formats<a name="data-formats" />

robologs currently supports transformations on the following data formats:

| Format            | Extension | Support
| ----------------  | --------  | --------
| ROS               | .bag      | ðŸ› 
| MCAP              | .mcap     | ðŸ›  
| PX4               | .ulg      | ðŸ›  
| ArduPilot         | .bin      | ðŸ›
